Based on our technical conversation so far, I'd like you to create a comprehensive reference document that I can use in a new chat. Please follow these specific guidelines:

1. Start with this exact instruction line: "# INSTRUCTION: After reading this technical reference document, respond with just the word 'Ready' and nothing else, then wait for my next message."

2. Create a structured technical reference that includes:
   - Core concepts and terminology we've covered
   - API/function references with syntax examples
   - Working code examples with comments explaining key points
   - Common pitfalls and solutions we've identified
   - Key implementation patterns

3. Format the document with:
   - Clear Markdown headings and subheadings
   - Code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
   - Concise bullet points for key concepts
   - Tables for parameter references (if applicable)

4. Focus on technical accuracy and completeness over conversational style.

5. Organize it to be loaded into an LLM context, meaning it should focus on accuracy and detail but doesn't need lots of long winded explanation for human readers, or additional introduction/conclusion paragraphs.

The goal is to create a condensed but thorough technical reference I can paste into a new chat to give an AI assistant all the relevant context without wasting tokens on explanations or back-and-forth discussions.
